# Know-How Dataset Links Evaluation

## Overview

* These datasets have been included in the evaluation of the [Human Activities Dataset](https://w3id.org/knowhow/dataset) created as part of [The Web of Know-How](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1054760/prohow/index.htm) project. The full analysis of the results is available [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1054760/papers/pareti_ekaw_2014.pdf). The automatically generated links (system links) and the community generated links (community links) have been annotated by two annotators as either correct/positive or incorrect/negative.
